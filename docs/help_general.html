    <h3>Views</h3>
    <body>
        For each detected display, the <em>View</em> menu provides 3 different views of monitor information. 
        Either 1 or any of the 3 can be selected depending on whether DDC communication with the display is successful. 
        <br><br>
        The views are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Monitor Summary</em> - Identifying information about the monitor, along with the first 128 bytes of the monitor's EDID block, 
                in hex form.
 
            
<li><em>Capabilities</em> - Reports the capabilities string returned by the monitor, along with interpretation based on the MCCS specification. 
            </li>
<li>
            <em>Features</em> - 

            Displays each of the feature codes detected, and allows for editing of feature values where appropriate.  Errors for individual features are reported here.
        </li>
</ul>

Rows in the <em>Features</em> view have the following fields:
                <ul> <li>Feature code - A one byte hexadecimal number </li>
                    <li>Feature name - Can vary depending on the version of the Monitor Control Command Specification that the monitor 
                        implements.</li>
                    <li><em>RW, RO, WO</em> - indicates if the feature can be read and/or written. </li>
                    <li>Type field. - <em>C</em> for "continuous" features, and <em>NC</em> for "non-continuous".  Continuous features can take any of range of values
                            up to some maximum value, for example feature x10 brightness typically takes values in the range 0..100 or the range 0.255. Non-continous features are those that can take one of a limited set of values, for example x60 Input Source, and also those that have a 
                            feature-specific definition, e.g. x9c Display Firmware Level, or xd9 VCP Version. As the MCCS specification has evolved,
                            <em>NC</em> has become a grab-bag for any feature not clearly continuous. 
                        </li>
                   <li> Feature Value - The form of the feature value field depends on the feature.  Modifyable continous features have a slider and spin box, either of which can be used to change the value, which can be changed. Modifyable  non-continuous features that can be changed typically have a drop down combo box showing the possible values. 
                   Features in the range xE0..xFF are reserved for manufacturer use.  As <em>ddcui</em> does not know how to 
                   interpret them, it simply allows for editing the individual bytes of the value.
                    </li>
                       </ul>
