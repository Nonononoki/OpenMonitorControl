        This dialog selects the features to be reported.  The features are specified as a group,
        and further refined by one or more filters on that group. 
        <br><br>
        The feature groups are: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>MCCS</em> - All features defined in the MCCS specification.
                Includes features in the manufacturer specific range (xe0..xff)
                Note that feature definitions vary by MCCS version.  <em>ddcui</em> depends 
               on monitors correctly reporting their MCCS version. 
                        </li>
<li><em>Capabilities</em> - All features defined in the capabilities string.
            <li>

                - Include only features in the group that are also found in the Capabilities string
