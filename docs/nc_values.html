<strong>Source of non-continuous feature values</strong>
<p>
        This option indicates the source of the values shown in the combo 
        box for simple non-continuous (NC) features. There are two sources 
        for the value codes.  Each has advantages and disadvantagles.
        
        <br>
        <list>
        <li> <em>MCCS</em> - The VESA Monitor Control Command Set specification lists valid values for simple Non-Continuous (NC) features. 
Values are a hex number from x00 to xff (0 to 255. For each hex number
the specification defines the meaning of the value. For example, for feature code x14 (Select color preset) value x01 means "sRGB". 
<p>
The advantage 
of this source is completeness.  
Valid values can vary by MCCS version, and <bold>ddcui</bold> takes this into account. The disadvantage is that the drop down list of values for a feature will likely include
values that do not apply to the particular monitor.  Also, there may be additional manufacturer specific values.
<li><em>Capabilites String</em> 
- The capabilities string returned by the monitor indicates the allowed values for a feature.  Unfortunately, the capabilities string
is sometimes wrong.  The capabilities string reports only hex numbers for feature codes and allowed values. The interpretation of values 
is still taken, if possible, from MCCS.
</list>
<p>
The possible choices are:
<list>
            <li>
                <strong>MCCS</strong>
                - The values are as specified in the VESA Monitor Control Command Set specification.
            <li> <strong>Capabilities string</strong>
                - The values are those listed in the Capabilities string. 
             <li><strong>Both</strong>
                 - The values shown are the union of those in the MCCS spec and those in the Capabilities string.  
        </list
<p><br>
In all cases the interpretation of values is, if possible, taken from MCCS.
